# Partas.Solid.Motion

Binding of `solid-motionone`. The library it is bound to is a thin wrapper over motionone, and it's not in the best state judging from the inactivity and stale issues/pulls.

Irregardless, this should be functional. The content of the binding is a bit of a mess, but it exposes the important aspects.
